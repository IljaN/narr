```

It is also possible to navigate to the Netflix home page. Narr will then download audio tracks of trailers or previews.

## How it works

Narr uses the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) to communicate with the
browser. It intercepts the network requests
and downloads the audio tracks in mp4 format. This is possible because the audio is not protected by DRM.

## Build from source

Narr is written in Go. You can build it from source with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IljaN/narr.git
make build_all
```

This builds binaries for Linux, Windows and MacOS (amd64 + arm64) and places them in the `bin` directory.
